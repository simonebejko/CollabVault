A personal collaborative project management platform built using Django. It provides me with a centralized platform for managing projects, items, and files collaboratively with users I personally grant authorization to.

### Features
- User registration and authentication
- Project creation and selection
- Item creation and management within projects
- Status assignment for items (e.g., "Draft," "Pending," "Published")
- File uploading, viewing, downloading, and deletion within items
- Storage of files in an AWS S3 bucket
